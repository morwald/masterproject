\section{Conclusion} \label{concl}

To conclude this master project has investigated a regularized version of the
four-sided cavity. The problem recovers similar bifurcations occurring in the
in the un-regularized version and seems agree well with the already calculated
bifurcation diagram.


With the intention of providing a benchmark. As we are looking at low Reynolds
numbers.
