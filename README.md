# Master Project: "Regularized Fourâ€‘Sided Cavity Flows: A Spectral Bifurcation Benchmark implemented in Julia"

Repository of my master project. Contains Tex files for the [PDF](./src/main.pdf)
of the report. The Julia code can be found here:
[FourSidedCavityFlow.jl](https://github.com/morwald/FourSidedCavityFlow.jl.git).

## Abstract 

This master project explores a regularized version of the four-sided lid-driven
cavity for incompressible fluids to be used as a validator benchmark for
Navier-Stokes solvers. The four-sided driven cavity is an extension of the
simple one-sided lid-driven case, where all lids move with the same velocity
profile and parallel lids move in opposite directions. This study focuses on a
regularized version to overcome corner singularities. The considered method
recovers exponential convergence with a pseudo-spectral Chebyshev
discretization scheme. The flow presents a variety of bifurcation scenarios and
could make up for an amenable Navier-Stokes bifurcation benchmark. The
algorithms are implemented in Julia, a high-performance language for scientific
computing. A developed Julia module provides a reproducible example for the
proposed problem.
