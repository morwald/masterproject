\subsection{Outline of Bifurcation Diagram}

The primary objective of this project was to reproduce the bifurcation diagram
presented in figure \ref{fig:bif_diag_chen} of \citet{chen2013}. The resulting
bifurcation diagram of the regularized version is depicted in figure
\ref{fig:bif_diag}, and a table is provided, listing the bifurcations that
occurred along with their corresponding critical Reynolds numbers. As
mentioned, only a square cavity is considered for this study, and no aspect
ratios have been varied.

The critical Reynolds numbers reported were determined by \red{linearly}
interpolating the eigenvalues between two states of the pseudo-arclength
continuation algorithm where the eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis in the
complex plane. The reported results are rounded to three significant digits.

    cavity flow, calculated by using the custom-developed Julia module} 
  \label{fig:bif_diag}
\end{figure}

Analyzing the new bifurcation diagram in figure \ref{fig:bif_diag} shows that
the regularized version resembles the non-regularized one regarding
bifurcations and the shape of the asymmetric branches. The reported critical
Reynolds numbers for the pitchforks $P_1$ and $P_2$ are close to those of the
original problem (scaled by $2$, see section \ref{sec:regul}). We can also see
how the regularized version converges rapidly, with only the changes third
decimal digits (or smaller) changing from a grid of size $48 \times 48$ or
larger for the two pitchforks and the saddle-node bifurcation. However, it is
worth mentioning that the pitchfork $P_2$ is not a true pitchfork as only
unstable branches (represented by the dashed line) join at this bifurcation.

On the other hand, it has been observed that the critical value for the
saddle-node in the regularized version deviates significantly from the original
value by approximately $80$ units of Reynolds. However, by increasing the
control parameter $k_0$ (fixed to $10$ in this study), the saddle-node appears
to shift further to the right. Consequently, this adjustment brings it closer
to the original bifurcation point, as it better approximates the discontinuous
step function of the boundary conditions. Nevertheless, one can not expect good
results when taking this limit as the boundary conditions are again "almost"
discontinuous.

Moreover, the Group of Nonlinear Fluid Dynamics at UPC discovered a Hopf
bifurcation ($H$) at the asymmetric branch. Furthermore, a pitchfork
bifurcation ($P_3$) was found with a critical Reynolds number close to the
saddle-node. Another branch is emerging at that location, displaying a
different asymmetric flow pattern. The following two subsections will discuss
these two bifurcation scenarios in more detail.

\subsection{Hopf Bifurcation and Time-Periodic Flows}

The Hopf bifurcation was found at a critical Reynolds of $348.319$ and has not
been reported in previous studies. Now, the question arises if the Hopf
bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical. 

For a subcritical case, we should be able to detect a stable time-periodic flow
at Reynolds numbers before and after the Hopf bifurcation. At higher Reynolds
numbers than the critical value of the Hopf, all steady solutions become
unstable, and if we launch a time-stepper with random noise, we should observe
time-periodic flows. If these orbits converge to a limit cycle, we can expect
that it will be a Hopf of subcritical nature.

Doing so does reveal trajectories converging to stable periodic orbits,
depicted in figure \ref{fig:orbits} for three distinct Reynolds numbers. The
orbits are visualized in a projection of the phase space using the average of
the vertical and horizontal velocities at the top and left mid-points of the
cavity (as defined in figure \ref{fig:cav_domain}). In figure \ref{fig:orbits},
the amplitudes of these oscillations are also shown by extracting the center
value of the streamfunction and are compared to the unstable branches. Notably,
the magnitudes are greater than an expected square root growth of amplitude for
unstable oscillations that characterize a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.

Further, stable periodic orbits exist below the Hopf bifurcation's critical
value. These orbits were obtained by extracting the solutions of the matrix
$\Psi$ with the maximum amplitude from an orbit at a higher Reynolds number and
then use this as an initial condition for the time-stepper. In this way, one
can "continue" the branch of periodic orbits backward in Reynolds, similar to a
natural continuation algorithm.

The periodic orbits collapse at a Reynolds number of around $335$, and time
evolutions at lower values will converge to one of the stable asymmetric
branches. 

Figure \ref{fig:orbits_zoom} shows a zoom of the phase portrait of figure
\ref{fig:orbits} on the trajectories of the stable periodic orbits close to
the upper unstable and stable branches. The blue dots refer to the value of
these stationary solutions. One can also recognize that the stable periodic
orbits pass close by the locally attracting lower unstable fixed point. The
periodic orbit with a Reynolds number of $336$ is getting even closer to this
fixed point. The collapse at around $335$ in Reynolds is suspected to form a
connection with this unstable lower branch. \\\\

  \caption{Zoom of periodic orbits at different Reynolds numbers, blue dots denote

  \label{fig:orbits_zoom}
\end{figure}

Additionally, unstable periodic orbits have been computed using the MATLAB
version, with the Reynolds number lower than the critical value of the Hopf.
The lower branch of these orbits connects to the lower asymmetric branch
through a homoclinic connection. Figure \ref{fig:sub_hopf_sketch} illustrates
what seems to be going on. It is still unclear what happens in the region after
the stable larger periodic orbits collapse and before the homoclinic
connection. Two stable solutions coexist in this interval, namely the stable
asymmetric branch and the stable periodic orbit. From a dynamical systems point
of view, these stable solutions must be separated by an unstable branch. 

Another option could be that these two branches are connected, forming a
saddle-node of orbits. However, this is not the case because the homoclinic
connection and the collapse of the subcritical periodic orbits happen at
different critical Reynolds numbers. What the separating branch is, remains
unclear, but the bifurcation likely corresponds to a subcritical Hopf.

\subsection{Pitchfork Bifurcation and New Asymmetric Solutions}

During the linear stability analysis conducted around the saddle-node, another
occurrence of an eigenvalue crossing and gaining a positive real part has been
identified. Figure \ref{fig:lsa} shows the three largest eigenvalues in a plot
where the Reynolds number increases and then decreases again from the
saddle-node onwards. The details of these crossings are presented in table
\ref{tab:cross}. The crossing labeled $A$ corresponds to the complex conjugate
pair associated with the Hopf bifurcation, which is denoted by $\lambda_1$ and
$\lambda_2$ in green. However, another eigenvalue crossing is found just before
the saddle-node, denoted as $B$. This second eigenvalue crossing ($\lambda_3$
in orange) lies within a range of $0.3$ in Reynolds. \\\\

    decreasing Reynolds number), the real part of the three largest eigenvalues

  \label{fig:lsa}
\end{figure}

Additionally, close to the saddle-node, another unstable branch emerges, which
was detected by starting the natural continuation algorithm near the critical
Reynolds of the fold. This branch is depicted in figure \ref{fig:branch2} and
contains unstable fixed points. The figure shows the projections onto the $\Psi$
and $u_T$ planes to distinguish the branches. One can see that for the new
branch, the center value of the streamfunction is not changing significantly,
whereas, for both the asymmetric and the second branch, there is a slight
change in the un-dimensional horizontal velocity $u_T$. Further, this branch is
connected to point $B$, corresponding to another pitchfork, denoted by $P_3$.
Linear stability analysis around the pitchfork of this new branch (figure
\ref{fig:lsa_branch2}) reveals how the eigenvalues can be related to point $B$
(i.e. $P_3$).

  \caption{3D plot of the asymmetric branch (blue) and second branch (light blue) and the
    connection of the two branches at pitchfork $P_3$ ($B$)}
  \label{fig:branch2}
\end{figure}

The emergence of the second branch provides an alternative perspective on the
problem. Since we are dealing with symmetric boundary conditions, we can
observe that the streamlines of the symmetric base solution in the four-sided
lid-driven cavity flow remain unchanged under a $\pi$-rotation and \red{a point
reflection at the origin} of the cavity. The second symmetry is broken for the
two asymmetric branches, which only conserve the $\pi$-rotation symmetry.
Figure \ref{fig:sol_branch2} illustrates the two solutions of the additional
pitchfork emerging at point $B$, and it can be seen that the rotational
symmetry is no longer valid for these branches. However, both branches exhibit
the rotational symmetry to one another.

  \label{fig:lsa_branch2}
\end{figure}

The question that remains is what happens at the saddle-node at point $C$. The
schematic in figure \ref{fig:schem_saddle} shows the evolution of the
eigenvalues, and figure \ref{fig:lsa_zoom} shows a detail on the real part of
the eigenvalues for figure \ref{fig:lsa}. After the Hopf bifurcation ($A$), we
have a complex conjugate pair with nonzero imaginary components and a positive
real part. From pitchfork $P_3$ ($B$) onwards, the additional eigenvalue
$\lambda_3$ has a real part that also becomes positive. What happens at the
saddle-node $C$ is, first of all, that the two eigenvalues lose their imaginary
part and become purely real. Moreover, this takes place at a nonzero real part.
What seems to be happening is that one of the complex pairs (now real) "jumps"
and becomes negative. The eigenvalue configuration is depicted in the complex
plane in figure \ref{fig:complexplane} to illustrate the behavior at the
saddle-node. This explanation is speculative because we cannot be sure that it
is the eigenvalue corresponding to the complex pair that becomes stable. It
could be that two positive eigenvalues meet at the saddle-node.

Another reason for being cautious with our interpretation is that the
saddle-node is a highly degenerated point where the Jacobian is
ill-conditioned. On top of these unreliably converged points of the Newton
solver, we are doing a linear stability analysis. Due to the degeneracy, it may
even be that the saddle-node corresponds to a double or triple zero, and
multiple eigenvalue crossings coincide. Nonetheless, these results were
obtained on a large grid for a pseudo-spectral code of size $96 \times 96$.
