\section*{Acknowledgement}

First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my
supervisors, Álvaro Meseguer, Arantxa Alonso, and Oriol Batiste, at the
Universitat Politècnica Catalunya in Barcelona. I am grateful for their sharing
of expertise, patients, and guidance throughout my master's project. A thank
you as well to the Nonlinear Fluid Mechanics group.

I would also like to thank my supervisor François Gallaire at EPFL, for
supporting me doing my master's project abroad and his valuable feedback.

Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their love and
support during this process. Without them, this journey would not have been
possible.
