This master project explores a regularized version of the four-sided lid-driven
cavity for incompressible fluids to be used as a validator benchmark for
Navier-Stokes solvers. The four-sided driven cavity is an extension of the
simple one-sided lid-driven case where all lids move with the same velocity
profile, and parallel lids move in opposite directions. This study focuses on a
regularized version to overcome corner singularities. The considered method
recovers exponential convergence with a spectral Chebyshev discretization
scheme. The flow presents a variety of bifurcation scenarios and can make up
for an amenable Navier-Stokes bifurcation benchmark. The algorithms are
implemented in Julia, a high-performance language for scientific computing. A
developed Julia module provides a reproducible example for the proposed
benchmark.
